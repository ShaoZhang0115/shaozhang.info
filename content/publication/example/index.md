abstract: Historical texts form the basis of the study of antiquities. In the
  case of Chinese historical texts different genres exist, e.g. chronological
  and biographical works etc. The contents of these texts normally consist of
  complex and interrelated information which covers long time period.
  Traditional history research relies heavily on information extraction and
  analysis by human researchers. With the recent development of the internet,
  data science and visualization technologies, digital history gradually
  attracts more and more attentions and in turn significantly impacts the field
  of historical study through altering the accessibility of the source
  materials, the narrative strategy and the analytical methodologies. This paper
  provides a system that enhances the Chinese historical research using word
  segmentation, texts analysis and visualization technologies. We can improve
  the workflow of traditional historical research via automatically detecting
  important keywords in Chinese historical texts and extracting, analyzing and
  visualizing the relations between a keyword and other words. This does not
  only accelerate the text based historical study but also to a great extent
  increase the scope of the search and analysis of the keywords in Chinese
  historical texts which used to be limited by the capacity of human
  researchers.
