abstract: Geoscientists, as well as researchers in many fields, need to read a
  huge amount of literature to locate, extract, and aggregate relevant results
  and data to enable future research or to build a scientific database, but
  there is no existing system to support this use case well. In this paper,
  based on the findings of a formative study about how geoscientists
  collaboratively annotate literature and extract and aggregate data, we
  proposed DeepShovel, a publicly-available AI-assisted data extraction system
  to support their needs. DeepShovel leverages the state-of-the-art neural
  network models to support researcher(s) easily and accurately annotate papers
  (in the PDF format) and extract data from tables, figures, maps, etc. in a
  human-AI collaboration manner. A follow-up user evaluation with 14 researchers
  suggested DeepShovel improved users' efficiency of data extraction for
  building scientific databases, and encouraged teams to form a larger scale but
  more tightly-coupled collaboration.
